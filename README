XML::Parser::Lite - Lightweight regexp-based XML parser

SYNOPSIS

  use XML::Parser::Lite;
  
  $p1 = new XML::Parser::Lite;
  $p1->setHandlers(
    Start => sub { shift; print "start: @_\n" },
    Char => sub { shift; print "char: @_\n" },
    End => sub { shift; print "end: @_\n" },
  );
  $p1->parse('<foo id="me">Hello World!</foo>');

  $p2 = new XML::Parser::Lite
    Handlers => {
      Start => sub { shift; print "start: @_\n" },
      Char => sub { shift; print "char: @_\n" },
      End => sub { shift; print "end: @_\n" },
    }
  ;
  $p2->parse('<foo id="me">Hello <bar>cruel</bar> World!</foo>');

DESCRIPTION

This Perl module gives you access to XML parser with interface similar to 
XML::Parser interface. Though only basic calls are supported (init, final, 
start, char, and end) you should be able to use it in the same way you use 
XML::Parser. Due to using experimantal regexp features it'll work only on Perl 
5.6 and may behave differently on different platforms.
